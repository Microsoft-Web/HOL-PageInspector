# Using Page Inspector in Visual Studio 2012 #

## Hands-on Lab ##

### Introduction ###

These Hands-On Labs are sets of step-by-step guides that are designed to help you learn Visual Studio 2012, ASP.NET 4.5 WebForms and ASP.NET MVC 4. Each Lab provides instructions to guide you through the process of developing a Web application.

In this Hands-on Lab you will discover a new tool to find and fix web page issues in Visual Studio. Page Inspector is a new tool that brings browser diagnostics tools to Visual Studio and provides an integrated experience among the browser, ASP.NET, and source code. It renders a web page (HTML, Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC, or Web Pages) directly within the Visual Studio IDE and lets you examine both the source code and the resulting output. Page Inspector enables you to easily decompose a website, rapidly build pages from the ground up, and quickly diagnose issues.

- **Assets:** This folder contains files that are used throughout the exercises.
- **_Exercise Name_:** Each exercise that requires a programming solution has its own code folder.
  - **Begin:** The begin solution is the initial incomplete solution that you will finish by following the steps of the corresponding exercise.
  - **End:** The end solution is the final result you will achieve at the end of an exercise.
- **Setup:** This folder contains the dependency files and the setup scripts necessary to initialize specific configurations of the lab, being its execution is required in the majority of the Hands-on Labs.
